BeatBox

An application where users will have an accessible personal account and can select and store music from a 3rd party api into their own playlists and save their song for random access.

Technologies used: html, css, javascript, react, express, node.js, a third party API, Postgres, SQL, Axios and a user authorization system (potentially Oauth)

User Story: Users will be able to create an account, create and store playlists with song information provided through an API and access them anytime they log in from any device connected to the internet. They can find songs through multiple categories such as artist, song name and genre. Our ideal user will be both a purveyor and connoisseur of great music that they can access anytime.
