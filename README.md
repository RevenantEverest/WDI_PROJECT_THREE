BeatBox

An application where users will have an accessible personal account and can select and store music from a 3rd party api into their own playlists and save their song for random access.

Technologies used: html, css, javascript, react, express, node.js, a third party API, Postgres, SQL, Axios and a user authorization.

User Story: Users will be able to establish an account, create, store and share playlists with song information provided through an API and access them anytime they log in from any device connected to the internet. They can find songs through multiple categories such as artist, song name and genre. Our ideal user will be both a purveyor and connoisseur of great music that they can access anytime.

Team Approach: Four team members built this application through dynamic collaboration via github. Two team members focused on the back end while the other two team members focused on the front end.  Diligent communication and cross functional communication were crucial in the development process.  The back end team laid down the framework for how the application will function and store user and API data. The front end sub team brought it all together with the user interaction, styling and work flow.  Back end team was responsible for establishing data tables and framing CRUD functionality.  Front end team with making the CRUD functionality accessible, user friendly and visually appealing.

API used: Music Match API
